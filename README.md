# Sex For Rent
The sex-for-rent scandal is a large issue that affects vulnerable young women and LGBT people looking for somewhere to live with little or no alternative. Rogue landlords offer up room for little or no rent, in return for sexual favours. The exploitative nature of these adverts has been discussed before in the press , but I wanted to try scaping them, in order to analyse primarily where most of the adverts were situated, and the language the landlords were using.

The scraping and visualisation was done in R, and you can see the [script here.](/Sex_For_Rent.R). The final [page](index.html) was build on top of bootstrap.
